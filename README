This is a simple, bare bones, Android native OpenGL ES 1.0 project.

A GLSurfaceView object manages the Java-side Activity lifecycle, while 
on the native C++ side, the native OpenGL ES 1.0 API is used to render 
3D graphics.

Android has a sample app "hello-gl2" which does something similar for 
OpenGL ES 2.0, but this uses OpenGL ES 1.0.  I also made it slightly 
fancier - a multi-color cube is spinning, and touching the screen 
alternatively stops and starts the rotation.


Code in the jni directory is under a BSD-style license and is based off 
code from Jetro Lauha's San Angeles Observation project, as well as code 
by Dennis Sheil.

The rest of the code is released under Apache License, Version 2.0.  
Some of that code is from the Android Open Source Project, some is from 
Dennis Sheil.
